Algorithm Assignment
GIven a sorted array of numbers, the task is to search for a given element in the array using binary search.
	
	Example 1
	Input:
Arr = [1, 3 , 5, 7, 8, 9]
		X = 5

	Output:
		“Element Found”

Input = [3, 2, 1, 56, 10000, 167]

Example 2
	Input:
Arr = [1, 3 , 5, 7, 8, 9]
		X = 6

	Output:
		“Element Not Found”



Find the number of the elements in array A that are divisible by 2 and greater than 15.
For example…
divisible(A)
divisible([2,3,12,18,42,24]) to return 3
divisible([100,84,37]) to return 2
divisible([5,8,6,12]) to return 0


Find the number of elements in an array Y, that are greater than or equal to the variable X and less than or equal to the variable Z

For example…
noOfElements(Y, X, Z)
noOfElements([2, 3, 0, 1, 7], 4, 8) to return 1
noOfElements([3 ,3 ,3, 5, 18, 6, 20], 15, 30) to return 2
noOfElements([4, 6, 2, 6, 7, 7], 0, 7) to return 6


Given two arrays, return the sum of the array with the highest value when its elements are summed respectively.

For example:
highestSum(X, Y)
highestSum([2, 5, 1, 0, 5, 7], [2, 3, 5, 6, 2, 1]) => 20
highestSum([ 15, 7], [12, 17]) => 29
highestSum([30], [3, 6, 2, 6]) => 30

GIven an array arr[] and an integer k where k is smaller than the size of array, the task is to find the kth smallest element in the given array. It is given that all array elements are distinct.
	
	Example 1:
	
Input:
arr = [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15]
	k = 3

Output:  7
Explanation: 3rd smallest element in the given array is 7

Example 2:
	
Input:
arr = [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15]
	k = 4

Output:  15
Explanation: 4th smallest element in the given array is 15
